# Preface {.unnumbered}

This project aimed to create a reusable and well-documented Quarto template
tailored to the needs of mathematicians, particularly for educational content.
The result is available at <https://FelixBenning.github.io/math-book/>, which
provides both the template and its extensive documentation.

This final report was generated using this template (reusing some of the
documentation) and is also available as a webpage at
<https://FelixBenning.github.io/HDZ_Projektbericht/>.
